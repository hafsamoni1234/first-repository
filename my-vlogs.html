            Let's find some beautiful view to lost together.Mountains teach that not everything in this world can be rationally explained.Mountains have a way of dealing with overconfidence.Even when the sky is filled with clouds, the sun still shines above them.You can’t blame me if I talk to the clouds</p>

         Everyone should believe in something. I believe I'll go to the beach.Feeling fintastic.Hanging with my gull-friends.Happiness comes in waves.Dear ocean, Thank you for making us feel tiny, salty, humble and inspired, all at once.There's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline, no matter how many times it’s sent away.

        Bandarban has been the most beautiful tourist destination of Bangladesh in recent years. Nature has adorned this region with its magnificent and splendid green ornaments. Beauty is scattered everywhere of Bandarban in magnanimous mood. One will find the virgin beauty of Bandarban on every step he or she advances. Nature is extravagant here. Behind the name of Bandarban there is an overwhelming story. Long time ago this district was a great natural habitat for monkeys and it was crisscrossed by numerous canals (jhiri). Monkeys used to collect fruits from forests on the other side of the canal and cross it. After eating and collection of fruits, they returned in the same way as a group.
